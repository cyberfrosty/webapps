    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
  </div>
<p>
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Frosty Web, we have a few fundamental principles:

    <ul>
      <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
      <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
      <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.
      <li>We encrypt all personal information stored on our servers.
      <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
    </ul>

<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>

<h4>Website Visitors</h4>

<p>Like most website operators, Frosty Web collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Frosty Web’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Frosty Web’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Frosty Web may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Frosty Web also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments. Frosty Web only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

<p>Certain visitors to Frosty Web’s websites choose to interact with Frosty Web in ways that require Frosty Web to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Frosty Web gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register to provide an email address, name and phone number. Those who engage in transactions with Frosty Web are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Frosty Web collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Frosty Web. Frosty Web does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>

<p>Frosty Web may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Frosty Web may monitor the most popular recipes or use attempted access to protected or non existent pages to help identify bots or malicious activity. Frosty Web may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Frosty Web does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

<p>Frosty Web discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Frosty Web’s behalf or to provide services available at Frosty Web’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Frosty Web’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Frosty Web will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Frosty Web discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Frosty Web believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Frosty Web, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Frosty Web website and have supplied your email address, Frosty Web may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Frosty Web and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Frosty Web takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Frosty Web uses cookies to help Frosty Web identify and track visitors, their usage of Frosty Web website, and their website access preferences. Frosty Web visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Frosty Web’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Frosty Web’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h4>Business Transfers</h4>

<p>If Frosty Web, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Frosty Web goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Frosty Web may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h4>Ads</h4>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Frosty Web and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Frosty Web may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Frosty Web’s sole discretion. Frosty Web encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
